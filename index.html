                <p>Russian has a LOT of allophony.</p>
                <p><strong>Palatalization and iotation</strong></p>
                <p>Russian distinguishes between palatalization (soft consonants, e.g. [kʲ]) and iotation (consonant followed by [j]).</p>
                <p>Palatalization is most transparently written with <code>ь</code> but with other ways of arising.</p>
                <p>Iotation is written with j-vowel characters.</p>
                <p><strong>Hard sign</strong></p>
                <p>An inserted <code>ъ</code> prevents the [j] of a j-vowel character from becoming palatalization on the preceding consonant.</p>

                <p>in order to coom, I must first draw for at least 10 minutes (with a timer!). it doesn't matter if I don't like what I end up drawing, because the goon afterwards is simply there to reward the effort, thereby conditioning me to enjoy the process of drawing more (I have no satisfying hobbies)</p>

                <p>In the modern day, true dragons are extinct (on Earth at least) because they knew that humans would drive them out, but because they have such a strong, almost royal innate need for bloodline preservation they bred with humans to keep their lineage alive.</p>
                <p>Subspecies most directly related to true dragons are upwards of 20", but most of the population is roughly human sized.</p>

                <p>cowgirls that are genetically destined to become huge. they're roughly human sized up until around 20, after which for about two years they have incredible hunger, gain 400lbs, and then their diet goes back to normal. it's like a physiological metamorphosis -- their body needs to grow to that size</p>
                <p>(timid, 600lb cowgirl meeting with human childhood friend over coffee) "I'm scared of change, yeah? It started happening at a time when I was already so aimless... just one more thing that I felt I had to grit my teeth to handle. But this is my body now, and I feel like I can enjoy it for what it is rather than pretend it wasn't there like I used to. Can we be friends again, even though I don't look much like you anymore?"</p>

                <h2>recall that I hate the idea of selling stuff / Last edited: Sun, May 4</h2>
                <p>I could make stickers, that could be My Thing. there's a good (I think) provider <a href="https://www.48hourprint.com/custom-stickers.html">here</a> and I could sell them on etsy or amazon or redbubble or design by humans or something</p>
                <p>the thing is the business model is "buy cheap in bulk and sell slightly more expensive in not bulk" so it's kinda a hefty down payment, and the resale isn't even that good like most people sell $5 for 50 stickers (or $3 for a particularly nice individual sticker, but I prefer packs)... AND the hard part is the marketing, getting the product is the easy part. at least shipping is just "put 10 stickers in an envelope with a little thank-you card and ship it through USPS to the person's address"</p>
