    </p>

    <p>I shud dra more so I can hide in a world of my own creation. I should draw a little bit each day, even if I don't like what I end up drawing, because I want to enjoy the process of drawing more (I have no satisfying hobbies)</p>

    <p>im going to intentionally limit myself to only drawing mildly curvy women cuz 1) limitation breeds creativity 2) I can just enjoy other people's art if I want to see hyper curvy women.</p>

    <p>small cute helpless chubby women with big boobs in a generic modern setting. drawn without color in 30 minutes with 15 minutes for the eyes and 15 minutes spend thinking what clothing looks cute</p>
