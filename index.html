    <p>This webpage is a project to get me to have <u>a hobby</u>; drawing hefty furry women living in 'scenarios,' which I compile into a collection of low-effort, inconsistent, stupid comics.</p>

<!--     <p>furries (irl) are so cool they just have a character and spend money to have people draw cute scenarios of their character, especially when they have detailed backstories about the character that they like to share</p>
    <p>Unlike humans, furs accrue no negative health effects from weight gain. In fur society, getting bigger for their spouse is a display of affection, loyalty, and marital satisfaction.</p>
    <p>"you made me this way. at least give me something to do" blob/immobile and furry go together like marshmallow fluff and, uh, bread</p>
    <p>it is not uncommon for a newlywed fur wife to gain up to 2,000 lbs in her first year of marriage, and around 1,000 every year thereafter.</p> -->

    <p>light fantasy furry conworld. jade has magical properties - only magicians approved by the high council are allowed to wear jade. magic is unexplained and just kinda happens, lending to its mysticism. also, bronze is used for a lot of things, mostly because I like it.</p>

    <p>I wish I could draw an OC but I always throw them in the trash after 2 days</p>
    <p>iterate, not abandon, oshi</p>
    <p>maybe trying exaggerated styles instead of exaggerated features would be fun</p>
