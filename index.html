                <p>in order to coom, I must first draw for at least 10 minutes (with a timer!). it doesn't matter if I don't like what I end up drawing, because the goon afterwards is simply there to reward the effort, thereby conditioning me to enjoy the process of drawing more (I have no satisfying hobbies)</p>

                <p>In the modern day, true dragons are extinct (on Earth at least) because they knew that humans would drive them out, but because they have such a strong, almost royal innate need for bloodline preservation they bred with humans to keep their lineage alive.</p>
                <p>Subspecies most directly related to true dragons are upwards of 20", but most of the population is roughly human sized.</p>

                <p>cowgirls that are genetically destined to become huge. they're roughly human sized up until around 20, after which for about two years they have incredible hunger, gain 400lbs, and then their diet goes back to normal. it's like a physiological metamorphosis -- their body needs to grow to that size</p>
