    <p>each particle has a state between [-1.0,1.0]</p>
    <p>negative particles move away from other particles, positive particles move towards other particles</p>
    <p>at every step, each particle samples all the particles in its neighborhood (including itself, following some kernel) to derive an average value, which is inputted into a function to derive its next state</p>
